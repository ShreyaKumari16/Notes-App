# Notes App

A simple **Notes** application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app allows users to add, view, and delete notes. Notes are stored in the browser's **localStorage**, so they persist even after refreshing or closing the browser.

## Features

- Write notes in a text area and add them to the notes list.
- View and delete existing notes.
- Notes are saved using **localStorage** so that they persist between page reloads.
- Simple and clean interface with a modern design.
